# Is_Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, sentence, verse, or even number that reads the same backward or forward. 
It derives from Greek roots that literally mean “running back” (palin is “again, back,” and dromos, “running.”) 

This algorithm uses stack and queue to determine if the word is a palindrome.
